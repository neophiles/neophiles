### Fueled by logic, built with passion

Hello! I'm Marc Neil, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a specialization in Software Engineering at Manuel S. Enverga University Foundation (Lucena). While I'm still early in my journey, I’m passionate about programming and eager to keep learning and improving.

My goal is to build meaningful projects, ones that reflect both my growth and curiosity. I may not know everything yet, but with dedication and consistency, I'm excited to see how far I can go.
